# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis
### The analysis should contain the following:

1. **Overview of the analysis** 
* Explain the purpose of this analysis.:

    > In this deliverable, Bobby was tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.


2. **Results** 
* Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed:

    > * From the finding of the eligible retirees, a very high Percentage of the workforce could retire at any given time. 
    > * From the job titles of the eligible retirees, the breakdown is below based on the table created in pgAdmin 4 off of the provided CVS files.
    > * 32,452 Staff
    > * 29,415 Senior Engineer
    > * 14,221 Engineer
    > * 8,047 Senior Staff
    > * 4,502 Technique Leader
    > * 1,761 Assistant Engineer
    
    
    
    

3. **Summary** 
* Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight.
    > **1)** How many roles will need to be filled as the the existing workforce begins to make an impact?.

    10's of thousands of roles are in urgent need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring at any given time. All departments should be aware of the amount of       potential employees they need may need to hire within the next few years. Processes should be inplace to make sure the company matches the amount of retirees and/or devise a 
    plan to match the output. Some roles may be phased out with automation weather by software or robotics. 
     
    > **2)** Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?  

    No, we have 1,940 employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to keep the company strong with knowledge.
